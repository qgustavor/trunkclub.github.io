Before I start writing about Trunk Club, I should probably introduce myself since I am a relatively new face around here.

I started at Trunk Club as a developer apprentice towards the end of June. I am the only one at the moment, but hopefully there may be others in the near future! My background is in Economics and Information Systems, and I worked as a .NET developer for a few months before deciding to go to Dev Bootcamp. I didn’t have enough experience to really succeed at my first job (I only took one programming course in college), so I needed to find something that would help me improve. Dev Bootcamp was the perfect solution for me, and I had an insanely good time going through the program. Not long after finishing there, I was able to get my job here as an apprentice (hooray!!).

My apprenticeship is 6 months with a review every 2 months. We break up our work into 2 week chunks, which we call sprints, so we decided that I will rotate teams every 2 sprints. As part of my apprenticeship, we thought it would be helpful if I could blog about what I’ve been learning each sprint. I’ll post blogs from the last few sprints over the next couple of weeks. 

I’m hoping that sharing some of my experiences will be useful for anyone just starting out, or thinking about becoming a developer. I love my job and ultimately, that’s what I want to share. I feel incredibly lucky to have landed where I have, and even more excited to see where the next several months take me!
