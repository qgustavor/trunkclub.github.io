This week we released the GeckoBoards that I’ve been working on for the last couple of weeks. With these, the company has access to key metrics about the health of the business. Before that, that data was either not available or required finance to dig into the database.

<!-- more -->

Working within our Rails app I learned to create a service layer that outputs the data in json. I used presenters and learned more SQL. GeckoBoard can then call our app and request the data to display it in nice widgets. However, I can already see us quickly outgrowing that solution as it has very little flexibility for the displaying of the data. It also doesn’t allow you to manipulate the data at all, and it would be nice to select specific date ranges. Still, pretty happy about my v1. And the management team was pretty excited as well. And asking for more.

This week I started reading Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler. Moving from marketing to programming has been a big career change for me. I probably established certain work habits over the last 12 years or so and I feel like this is a good time to “empty my cup” and get some good advice on what it takes to be a good developer, besides knowing how to program.

It’s been very good so far. I particularly like the early parts on the place of a developer within a company, how he/she needs to contribute to the business and that should be his number one priority.

Next week we’re finalizing our apprenticeship list and I’m going to be pairing a lot more.
