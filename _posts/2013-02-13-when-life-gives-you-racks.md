build standing pairing stations.

Who am I?

Let me start this post by introducing myself. I’ve been a Software Engineer at [Trunk Club](http://trunkclub.com/) for a little over six months and previous to that I was a Senior Software Engineer at [DRW Trading](http://drw.com/). In addition to these full-time jobs I’ve also been involved in a few side projects.

I attended the University of Michigan where I received my degree in computer science. After I graduated there in the winter of 2007 I moved to Chicago to do what any other recent college graduate does, start my career, which is when I started at DRW.

Since then I’ve had the opportunity to learn a variety of different things from a variety of people. These lessons range anywhere from dark text-editor themes being easier on the eyes to using message queuing systems to create a distributed app eco-system. Another such lesson is the benefits of being able to stand while working.

Getting things done

I’m not going to talk too deeply about the pros and cons of standing and sitting while at work. You can find various articles and blog posts about them (I’ve listed a few at the end). In short, you burn more calories, your back and lower body will hurt less (after getting used to standing more), and even increases in your productivity. And personally, I will tell you that I had the opportunity to experience standing all day, and it’s something that everyone should try.

If you ask any of my current colleagues at Trunk Club they’ll tell you that when I think something is benefinical, I don’t keep my mouth shut. In the past six months due to some of my vocal persistence, the tech team has transitioned towards more consistent pairing throughout the day. As soon as pairing became the daily norm, I turned some of my attention towards being able to stand while we pair. After several converstaions with Mike Wolf, one day we decided that we had to find a way to “test it out”, since purchasing a true standing desk was expensive for something no one else on the team had tried.

Just some racks



MVP then refactor

As is the case with both writing code and a startup, rarely does one end up building the final solution on their first attempt. For developers, we are constantly writing the minimum to get a broken test to pass and then refactoring to a more elegant solution over time. Trunk Club has taken a similar approach to our technology as well. Three years ago our website was nothing more than a WordPress Blog, now we have several different applications supporting our company. And we are constantly making that even better.

But wait, I thought we were talking about standing desks? Yes! We are! Our first foray into the world of standing at work didn’t require an $800 desks that can be moved up and down. (Actually it’s more like $1600 since we pair.)

We took a page out of MacGyver’s play book and built something from what we had all around our office. What was that? baker’s racks, or as we use them, clothing racks. The metal racks with adjustable shelving allowed Mike Wolf and I were able to create Trunk Club’s first standing pairing station.

The standing pairing station is in such high demand, that we’ve constructed a second. After the second version, we’ve begun discussing possible refactorings to our solution, which include buying a version of the aforementioned desks top solutions.

Do you or your team stand on a regular basis? What solution do you use? Want to come see our bakers rack? Drop by TCHQ and check it out while we have beer. Let me know [@joelash](https://twitter.com/joelash)

Some links on standing

Here are some of the links I’ve used to validate my personal experiences. I’m more interested in your experiences as opposed to research. Let me know what you think.
