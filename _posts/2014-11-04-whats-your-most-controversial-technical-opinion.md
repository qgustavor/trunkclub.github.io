At Trunk Club, I think one of the most specialized and skilled tasks we perform is finding more engineers to work with us. Hiring is one of the most difficult things we do around here, and it’s one of the most important areas I can contribute towards. There’s already a pretty decent amount of material out there on how to hire people in technology, some of my favorite coming from [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html) and [Steve Yegge](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/five-essential-phone-screen-questions). However, I think sometimes we’re too quick to decide technical chops are paramount, and little else matters if you find somebody with a solid technical ability.

How do you hire for non-technical ability? What even matters when it comes to “soft” skills? Unfortunately, I think a lot of people end up leaving it to “gut feel”. I hate to consider that thought. Decisions like whether or not to bring somebody on to your team should be more calculated. This is somebody’s career we’re talking about! The furthest I’ve been able to take the idea is: will I enjoy spending the weekday with this person? It’s not concrete, but at least it feels less like I’m leaving it up to my subconscious Eight Ball.

When trying to judge for soft skills, my favorite goto question is, “What’s your most controversial technical opinion?” It’s usually followed by a short moment of awkward silence as the candidate considers something they probably didn’t prepare for. Then I usually hear something rarely all that controversial. Something like, “test driven development isn’t appropriate all of the time”, or, “sometimes the hacky solution is the right solution”. That’s ok, I bet they’d have a more controversial answer if they felt like they had more time.

While writing this I realized I rarely remember what specific opinion the candidate even voices. It’s really not that important… hell, I typically don’t even hold it against the candidate if I think they’re wrong. What’s important is the conversation that follows that question. I get to don my innocently-ignorant hat, or perhaps my asshole-contrarian hat. I’m really interested to see how solidly the candidate sticks with their controversial opinion. Does the candidate fold like a deck of cards or stubbornly stand by their opinion even as the opposing case mounts?

I like the question because it helps you paint a picture about what it’s like to work with the candidate, and in a way that watching them write code might miss. Will they tell me when I’m making a poor decision? Are they open to counter points when arguing for a specific approach? Is it engaging when they disagree with me, or just painful? Will they enrich my day at the office, or will they tax it to no benefit? These are all questions just as important to me as ones that uncover a candidate’s technical expertise.

At the end of the day, I want to be careful not to voice some recipe for success in hiring. I don’t think such a thing exists. That’s probably my not-so-controversial controversial opinion. I think there’s no good substitute for continually making smart decisions again and again, and hiring is no exception. Questions like mine help to introduce more moving parts, and with those moving parts come additional opportunities to gain insight and learn about the candidate. In other words, they give you some extra chances to make smart decisions when hiring the next member of your team.
