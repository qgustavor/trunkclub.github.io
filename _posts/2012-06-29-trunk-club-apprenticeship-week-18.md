Now that felt great: I worked on a project that was very similar to last week’s Kissmetrics project, except this time it took me two days to finish it instead of five! I’m now completing projects regularly and I have code to commit to the release every week. My contribution level is definitely increasing on a weekly basis.

<!-- more -->

Part of it is understanding our code base better, but part of it is also having a much smoother workflow. I program, test, commit, present/test with stakeholders with much more ease now, which allows me to focus more on my code. Things are easier with the product team. I feel like I’m more helpful and pro-active with them, and we get more done.

I’m also able to quickly build upon what I have just learned, needing less time to digest. Tuesday night, at the end of the day, I received a request for a feature and was able to get it done just a few hours later. A few weeks ago such time constraints would guarantee not finishing on time, but this one was doable thanks to the projects that I worked on the last few weeks. I feel like I can take on a much wider variety of projects now. I probably just need more time to complete them than others (which I don’t mind taking), and even that is slowly getting better. It’s all about adding more value.

I finished reading Seven Languages in Seven Weeks. I’ll post my notes on Seven Languages shortly, but the short take on it is this: Great book, helped me understand how other languages (non-OO, functional etc.) function, and what the best use for some of them is. Sometimes it was a bit above my level, but never enough not be understandable and useful. I’m going to pick one of the languages to play with it (Scala or Haskell?) and I’ll probably read the book again in a few months. This week I went back to a non-coding book and started reading [Agile Samurai](http://amzn.com/1934356581) by Jonathan Rasmusson.

This weekend I will be finishing up preparing for my four month review on Monday. The last couple of months have been awesome, with an acceleration of my learning mid-way through, and I’m excited to present it to the team.

Next week: Review, working in a smaller team, Kissmetrics and Trunkboards version 2.
