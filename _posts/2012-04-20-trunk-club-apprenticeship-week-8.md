After listening to Corey Ehmke’s presentaion on MongoDB last week I decided to try and implement Mongo for data snapshots. I gotta say I had a lot of fun pairing with Corey and realizing how awesome Mongo is. Now thanks to this exercise we’re saving snapshots of data to look at historicals. Sweet!

I ended up presenting about Mongo at our weekly team lunch. I wanted to share what I learned as well as my excitement. It was mostly a code review with some good feedback from the rest of the tech team. It also reminded me that I need to work a lot more on my presentation skills…

This week Gilt’s co-founder Alexandra Wilson came to talk to us. Her experience starting and growing a business like Gilt was very interesting. A lot of the talk focused on sales and marketing but there were also some interesting questions and remarks about technology. While we’re not direct competitors (we don’t do discounts), we do go after some of the same customers, so it was interesting to hear her story.

Next week will be busy: GoodData demo, finishing a daily report email for finance and our first hack day on Friday!
