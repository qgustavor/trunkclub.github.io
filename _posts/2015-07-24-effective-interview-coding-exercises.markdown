At Trunk Club, every engineer writes code. Every one of them. That means we have to have some well-trusted coding exercises under our belts for interview time. These exercises help us assess whether a candidate has strong coding chops and engineering skills (they'll definitely need those on the job). Coding ability isn't the only thing we test for, but it's one of the most important. We're continuously trying new things, never trusting our existing process to be perfect, so we've learned some lessons along the way.

###An effective coding exercise should not require knowing *one weird trick*

I always tell people: your coding exercise should be able to tell me if the candidate would perform well at Trunk Club. We don't learn much about a candidate if the exercise tests whether or not they took the interviewer's Algorithms 201 class in college. We waste everybody's time if our exercises begin to resemble riddles. If I sense a candidate is stuck on some arbitrary part of an exercise, I'll often help them through it. I want to see how the entire dish turns out, and I don't get to do that if I discount a candidate for getting stuck on the specific stove we use.


###An effective coding exercise should allow for incremental progress

A good exercise will reward the candidate with signs of progress many times before the final result is achieved. If there’s no sign of success until the entire solution *just works*, I suspect you’re producing some false negatives. Keep in mind that a candidate who doesn’t understand how to incrementally build towards a solution is a separate issue, and certainly not necessarily the fault of your coding exercise.

And while we’re talking about incremental progress, I strongly believe that your candidate should be demonstrating that progress while executing code in a development environment. No whiteboards, no hand waving, just real code running live on a machine. To support this, always be ready to provide a candidate with an environment that they’re comfortable with. Offer to let them provide the machine if they’d prefer. If you’re interviewing over the phone, we’ve had a lot of success with [coderpad.io](https://coderpad.io/).

###An effective coding exercise should not select for candidates with arbitrary cultural knowledge

A good coding exercise shouldn't require prior context in order for a candidate to do well. For example, if your exercise involves some working knowledge of a sport only popular in America, it's probably not a great exercise. It's ok if your exercise requires presenting the candidate with some domain knowledge, but keep it brief and simple enough such that the candidate only needs a few minutes to understand as much as they need to in order to work through your exercise.

###An effective coding exercise should only test for relevant abilities

At Trunk Club, our backend stack is primarily Ruby. That being said, you shouldn't need to know Ruby to get through our coding exercises. We probably won't even make you solve them in Ruby. The relevant ability we're looking for is solid engineering chops. That sort of ability tends to transcend programming languages. On the other hand, we also hire mobile engineers for Android and iOS. For mobile positions like those, we tend to be a little more strict on the tech stacks candidates have experience with. So, coding exercises for those candidates will very often be in Java, Objective C, or Swift. If it's vital for the job you're hiring for, be sure to test for it. Otherwise, who cares?

###An effective coding exercise should be solvable in the time provided

Something I hear a lot that gives me cause for concern is: "The candidate seemed pretty smart, but they didn't finish the exercise." Trying to decide on an exercise to present interview candidates with? Before you do, find a coworker who hasn't seen your particular exercise before and watch them complete it. More often than not, you'll find that it takes a qualified engineer longer than you expected to complete the exercise. Pretty typical for software, right?

Or, and this is my preferred approach, don't penalize candidates for failing to complete the exercise. Candidates rarely finish the exercises I present them with. An important note: I always tell candidates that I'm not expecting them to finish the exercise. This gives me a great opportunity to work with them on a problem in a more natural setting (aka no timer ticking away in the background). I explain that I'd rather they slow down and talk me through their approach, and that I'd like to see how they write code when they take the time to do things the way they want to without rushing.

###An effective coding exercise should be a collaborative effort

I don't like sitting back and silently watching somebody code. It's uncomfortable for everybody involved. Ideally, I'll even ask to drive for a bit when the candidate is stuck on something arbitrary that doesn't really tell me much about their capabilities (remember: remove tricks and riddles). I might even code with them as a "normal" pair if things are flowing well. After all, I'd like to know what they're like to work with, not just how they code off on their own. If you solve the problem with the candidate, while of course probably letting them lead, ask them to bring you along on their problem solving process. You get a chance to learn much more about what it's like to work with them than if they just show you a finished solution.

###An effective coding exercise should be at least moderately novel

If it shows up on the first page of a Google search about interview exercises, it's probably not a good choice. I really only include this last section to encourage people to do something more creative than FizzBuzz, simple string manipulation, or inverting a binary tree. Sometimes I'll even ask if the candidate has worked through an exercise like mine before. You'll find it's pretty easy to tell if they're being honest.

Finally, no exercise is perfect. As you conduct coding interviews, try to keep an eye out for moments where your exercise is failing both you and the candidate. A capable interviewer will learn how to assess a candidate in light of an exercise's shortcomings. Also, don't get too comfortable with an exercise! When I see interviewers begin to conduct exercises on auto-pilot, it's time for them to switch it up. If it feels like you're following a script, try something new.

I hope you found this helpful. Let us know if you've run into lessons that we haven't come across yet!
