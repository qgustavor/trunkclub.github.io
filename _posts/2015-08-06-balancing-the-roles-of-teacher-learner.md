### The Teacher/Learner Dichotomy

There are a few core qualities we try to uphold as an engineering team, one of these (well, more of a two-for-one) is to balance the roles of both a **teacher** and a **learner**. For better or for worse, I've never had a problem upholding the learner end of the bargain. Since the beginning of my Trunk Club career I've traversed the spectrum from product design to front-end development to iOS, spanning internal and consumer facing experiences alike. 

My curiosity in these different disciplines and areas of business has necessitated my role as a learner. When doing a gut check on my success in the teacher/learner balancing act, I decided to make it a personal goal to get out into the community and extend some of my experiences to those eager to learn.

### Enter: Startup Institute

Around that time I was approached by a friend gauging my interest in doing some adjunct instructing at [Startup Institute](https://www.startupinstitute.com/) (perfect timing, right?). Not only was it an opportunity to go out and teach some hard skills, but also to do so in the context of a startup environment that values the _why_ just as much as the _how_. I've since given workshops that combine instruction with real world exercises in prototyping and user testing, as well as designing for context and performance (which I synthesized down to this small [blog post](http://blog.startupinstitute.com/2015-6-17-user-experience-design-in-context/)). Students are then able to employ these new concepts in projects that run the duration of their program.

### Bringing it Full Circle

Teaching in these environments is thrilling. You get exposed to some seriously talented and motivated inviduals. But most of all, the personally rewarding (and frankly unexpected) product of this process has been seeing how teaching and learning so elegantly complement and inform one another. Formulating lesson plans, giving demos, and being able to simplify concepts and practices down to something easily understandable acts as a testament for how well you've actually learned that thing. Following the cycle of learning to teaching has become a great way for me to judge my understanding of something I practice. It acts as a meter to indicate what stage of learning or teaching I'm at (and when to switch focuses to balance those out).

### Go Forth and Learn/Teach!

At Trunk Club we have an array of ways to put the teacher/learner revolution into motion. A couple things that have worked great for us:

#### Lunch & Learns

This is a great way to dog food (pun intended) a subject that you want to teach. Get a few coworkers together interested in learning something and do a short workshop over lunch.

**Pros:** generally casual and people love free lunch.

**Cons:** talking with your mouth full and people only showing up for the free lunch (feel free to be selective about your audience).

#### Focus Fridays

At Trunk Club we reserve our Friday afternoons to work on things totally off of our roadmap. This could be fixing a problem that's been bugging you forever, prototyping a new idea, or exploring new tools. For example: pairing up with another engineer is a great way to both teach and learn at the same time. Many of our mobile and front-end developers work with our backend engineers to learn about how our systems work (and vice versa).

#### Hack Days

Like Focus Fridays but generally with more structured teams and much more rapid production. Hack days are perfect opportunities to try out a new library or tool on a real-world problem, and hopefully extend that knowledge to the rest of your team.

When something from one of these practices emerges and proves to be especially meaningful, consider taking it out to the community in the form of a course/talk/event/etc. It's been an incredibly rewarding process for me and something I plan to continue.
