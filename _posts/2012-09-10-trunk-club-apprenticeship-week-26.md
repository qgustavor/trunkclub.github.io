So … it’s been eight weeks since my last blog post. The last blog post I wrote said: “Next week: Review, working in a smaller team, Kissmetrics and Trunkboards version 2.” The review went very well, the second part of my apprenticeship was eye-opening and I definitely felt like I turned a corner. Concepts and patterns were easier to understand, I felt more useful when pairing, and I was able to get more done.

Teams have been broken down into smaller team focused on specific functions within the company, and I completed the Kissmetrics and Trunkboards v2 projects.

To be honest, the last eight weeks are a big blur. It’s been very intense, a race to the finish to accomplish as much as I could during this apprenticeship. I wish I had blogged more but it was not a priority: If I were to graduate from my apprenticeship and become an engineer, I would no longer have the luxury of being an apprentice, i.e. spending so much time learning. So I made the most of the time I had left.

I had my final review at the end of last month. Everyone from the tech team was there, plus a few people from the product team. I did two presentations: one just for the tech team, highlighting everything that I learned, and a second presentation for the larger group talking about the apprenticeship itself, how I got there and what I got out of it, followed by questions and answers.

It was awesome to list the stuff that I had learned, and also see how much more there was for me to learn. I appreciated getting feedback on my performance and hearing what people thought I should focus on next.

I left the room to let the group discuss what was now my application for an engineering position. I would be leaving for a pre-planned trip to Europe just two days later and would be gone for almost three weeks, so I was eager to hear the outcome of the apprenticeship before leaving. The day after the final review, before a happy hour event with the sales team, I got the great news from Mike Cruz that Trunk Club was offering me a position as a Software Engineer. I’m very happy and excited to have accepted that offer today.
