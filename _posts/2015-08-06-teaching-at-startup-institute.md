### The Teacher/Learner Dichotomy

When assessing our own culture within Trunk Club Tech, there are a few core qualities that we consistently revisit to make sure we're upholding as individuals. One of these (well, more of a two-for-one) is to balance the roles of both a teacher and a learner. For better or for worse, I've never had a problem upholding the learner end of the bargain. Since the beginning of my Trunk Club career I've traversed the spectrum from product design to front-end development to iOS, spanning internal and consumer facing experiences alike. My curiosity in these different disciplines and areas of business focus has necessitated my role as a learner. When doing a gut check on my success in the teacher/learner balancing act, I decided to make it a personal goal to get out into the community and extend some of my experiences to those eager to learn.

### Enter: Startup Institute

Around this time I was approached by a friend gauging my interest in doing some adjunct instructing at [Startup Institute](https://www.startupinstitute.com/) (perfect timing, right?). Not only was it an opportunity to go out and teach some hard skills, but also to do so in the context of a startup environment that values the _why_ just as much as the _how_. I've since given intensives that combine instruction with real world exercises in prototyping and user testing, as well as designing for context and performance (which I synthesized down to this small [blog post](http://blog.startupinstitute.com/2015-6-17-user-experience-design-in-context/)). Students are then able to employ these new concepts in projects that run the duration of their program.

### Bringing it Full Circle

Aside from getting to hangout with some seriously talented and motivated individuals, one of the most unexpected and rewarding products of this process has been using teaching as a benchmark for learning and vice versa. Formulating lesson plans, giving demos, and being able to simplify concepts and practices down to something easily understandable acts as a testament for how well you've actually learned that thing. Following the revolution of learning to teaching has become a great way for me to judge my understanding of something I practice or claim to know, and acts as a meter to indicate what stage of learning or teaching I'm at (and when to switch focuses to balance those out).

### Go Forth and Learn/Teach!

At Trunk Club we have an array of ways to put the teacher/learner revolution into motion. A couple things that have worked great for us:

**Lunch & Learns**

This is a great way to dog food (pun intended) a subject that you want to teach. Get a few coworkers together interested in learning something that you can offer and do a short session over lunch. **Pros:** generally casual and people love free lunch. **Cons:** talking with your mouth full.

**Focus Fridays**

At Trunk Club we reserve our Friday afternoons to work on things totally off of our roadmap. This could be fixing a problem that's been bugging you forever, prototyping a new idea, or exploring new tools. Pairing up with someone who is able to provide some guidance in an area you're exploring or someone interested in learning from your direction is a great way to provide teacher/learner value for both parties.

**Hack Days**

Like Focus Fridays but generally with more structured teams and much more rapid production. Hack days are perfect for fast immersion in new tools from experts that use them (your coworkers) and providing support for those looking to do the same.

When something from one of these practices emerges and proves to be especially meaningful, consider taking it out to the community in the form of a course/talk/event/etc. You might learn something too!
