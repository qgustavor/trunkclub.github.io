The tech team came up with a list of tasks that every member of the team should complete in order to better understand the business. Building tools for other functions of the company helps us to understand what those departments do and how we can help them.

I attempted to go through this task list in one week and blog about the experience.

__Operations__

I got to fulfill a trunk, pack a trunk and unpack a trunk return. It took me less than an hour to go through it, and it showed me some of the pain points that our ops team is going through, especially as we scale so rapidly.

__Sales__

One of the most fun tasks was to participate in a training session: Once a week, the sales team picks three items, and creates a scenario for each outfit. These are usually items that sell well but are not often enough put in trunks. For each item we get a member profile: an imaginary member with a specific age, budget, location, profession. My item was a green sweater, and “my guy” lived in Miami and really wanted that green sweater, which I paired with white pants and an orange belt. I got the second most votes for my outfit and actually learned a lot. I need to attend these sessions more often (and win!).
I also got to participate in a cold call, get a repeat styling, and build a trunk for a customer. (Update: the trunk came back and was a success!! The customer kept several items and the sale was double the average trunk value).

__Finance__

I went through the process of billing a trunk… I’ve worked a lot with the finance team since I started here, and we’ve made huge progress using technology to simplify tasks. Going through this exercise highlighted even more features we can build for them. 
Customer Service:
I answered customer calls, checked out in-person fittings in POS and tracked down delinquent trunks. These guys do an amazing job considering the inefficiencies of some of the tools that they have at their disposal. We can definitely help here.

__Merchandising__

I participated in a product training meeting, (mock-)ordered a product, and realized how painful it was to enter a new product into Quickbooks.
Technology:
I gave a Lunch and Learn entitled “How we’ve been doing our releases (January 2013)” and finally wrote a blog post to round up the task list (you’re reading it).
This has been very rewarding and enlightening. I’ve already fixed a few issues brought up during my training. Because the business is growing and evolving so fast, I definitely want to go through this list again in a few months. Can’t wait to see how much better we’re doing!
