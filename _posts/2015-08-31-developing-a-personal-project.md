Being an apprentice at Trunk Club has been a great experience, and part of the experience is developing your own personal project. Over the course of my apprenticeship, I had to find an idea, pitch a product, and learn about the associated technologies and systems required to make the project come to life. The whole process taught me a lot about what it means to be a developer with an entrepreneurial spirit.

I started by looking for themes that are important to our business, i.e. how could we highlight the expertise of our stylists? How could we improve communication between our stylists and our members? I found these themes by listening at internal meetings, reading our marketing materials and researching the mission and values of our company. These themes gave me a jumping off point in thinking through ideas that would provide the business with value.

My next step was talking with other apprentices and mentors to ask their advice. A fellow apprentice advised me to look for a process that people were doing manually that could be better with an app. This required some research, and I ended up spending hours chatting with and watching people in other departments at work. This was an invaluable experience; Not only did I learn more about how the company operates, but I got to see how people at their job interact with the products we're building. I discovered that many people I worked with had unexpected processes involved in their jobs, and talking with those users provided a lot of perspective that reshaped how I thought about building my project.

Ultimately, I picked a project that I was excited about and one that involved technologies I was interested in learning. I tried to scope the project so that it wasn't something that would be urgently needed for the business so that I could take my time learning and experimenting, but strived for something that could be useful and had room to grow or could be built upon. I spent some time talking through some strategies with my mentor, such as where the project should live and what tools I should use to build it. Eventually, I set about trying to make it happen.

Throughout the course of the project I've sought advice from a project managers, designers, sales people and really anyone who was able to help. Talking with other experts gave me valuable feedback that I needed to improve my product, as well as insight into their roles in the business. I learned that being a developer here involves more than just writing code, but also working with other people to make your products better.

If you want to build up your skills, I would encourage anyone to find something within their company that could be made better with software within your area of interest and make it or fix it! Youâ€™ll learn more about the work that others do and more about how to build a product, so everyone wins! Does your workplace allow time for side projects? What are some things that were helpful for you when developing a personal project?
