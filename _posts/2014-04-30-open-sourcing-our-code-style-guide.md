Over the last year TC has been standardizing on coding styles to help us achieve a goal originally seen in one of Mark Otto's repos.

> All code in the codebase should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contribute.

No doubt an idealistic goal, a couple of things are needed to achieve this:

- A well promoted style guide
- Something to aspire to (_Error:_ Maximum call stack size exceeded.)

During a talk at Fluent Conf this year one of the speakers encouraged attendees to open source their style guides. Similar to open source software, having an open source style guide is a great way for individuals and companies to give back to the communities which helped them grow. And so it is with great pleasure Trunk Club opens [our style guide](https://github.com/trunkclub/styleguide), currently with standards on CoffeeScript, HTML, CSS and SASS and plenty of room for growth.

Items introduced to the style guide are intended to meet one end, and that's a single voice, recognizable to everyone. Please let us know if you have questions. And thanks for being awesome.
