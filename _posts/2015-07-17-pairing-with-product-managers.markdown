Pairing with other software engineers is commonplace. When a bug or feature is too risky or too big to handle reasonably alone, we often pair up to hack at a problem together. Some companies encourage their developers to pair all the time, and others suggest pairing only when deemed necessary. Regardless of frequency, pairing is widely accepted as a reliable method of reducing the number of bugs produced as code is written.

Pairing with engineers is great, and we love it here. But have you considered pairing with your product manager?

At Trunk Club, we have a few different development teams focusing on different areas of our architecture. We have member-facing teams, a platform team, a sales team, a back-office team, and smaller teams within those groups focusing on very specific problems. On each large team, a product manager is responsible for road maps and feature planning. They're in tune with the company and stakeholders, seeking out feedback and presenting demos frequently so developers have the most up-to-date, correct information on what to build.

It should be obvious by now where I'm going with this.

We're fortunate at Trunk Club in that many of our product managers have some level of development experience, whether that be a bootcamp or hobbyist programming. Regardless of technical aptitude, pairing with a product manager on a particularly tricky or risky feature can provide a few benefits for everyone involved.

Product managers are generally the closest to the business and stakeholders, which means that they understand what developers should be building very well. They also love to break things (in a good way!) which means your code will get a good workout while it's being built. The further someone is from the code itself, the more likely they are to effectively QA a feature. This all adds up to pairing with your product manager being a productive experience. You'll likely end up with less bugs, a more complete idea of how to QA the features, and less features delivered that are incorrect due to miscommunication or mistakes.

Here's another bonus: you end up with two people who care about the business working together to come up with great ideas. Some of the most innovative ideas at Trunk Club have come from relationships like this.

So give it a try! Sit down for an hour or two to build out a feature or squash a bug with your product manager. We think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the outcome, but either way drop us a line in the comments and let us know.
