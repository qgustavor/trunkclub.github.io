What a great week: I just built an entire Rails app from scratch for Trunk Club. GeckoBoard was not giving us enough flexibility and the charts were too big for the largest widget size allowed. So I more or less built a custom version of GeckoBoards for Trunk Club.

<!-- more -->

Thanks to the Sinatra app that I built last week it was easy to just get the data by calling the API that we used to push data to GeckoBoards. After the initial setup, I spent a big part of the week on implementing Highcharts (fun) and I spent the other part of the week working on the look and feel of the app with SASS (more fun). And I also implemented a feature to send a daily email in the morning to stakeholder so that they see yesterday’s KPIs on their way to work, a feature to export a dashboard to pdf to share it with others, and authentication through Devise using our employee database. Woo!

I keep feeling like I need less help. I still get stuck but not against a wall, just slowly making progress and eventually getting there. However, the week was pretty long and I haven’t been really good at pacing myself or doing apprenticeship tasks such as reading and bogging. I think it’s ok every now and then but I don’t want to get burned out either.

Next week: resuming blogging, moving on to another project, planning for four months apprenticeship review.
