Less than six months after deciding to change careers from marketing to programming and just a couple of months after finishing Code Academy, I landed at Trunk Club as their first apprentice!

Trunk Club is a service for men who want to look great without having to go shopping in stores or online. You receive handpicked outfits chosen by a dedicated style expert. Trunks are shipped to your door, only when you want them. Keep what you love, send back the rest. And we find the best styles so members don’t have to.

We’re multilingual, using primarily Ruby on Rails with Postgresql. The codebase, while not too intimidating, should definitely take me a few days to familiarize myself with. It sounds like we’re very curious about other tools and technologies, which is pretty exciting to me.

The apprenticeship is not completely defined, the idea being that we will work together on defining it over the next few weeks and tweak it before bringing on more apprentices. But a few things are already set:

- It’s a six month program. It loosely follows some of the same principles as the Obtiva apprenticeship, with a review every two months.
- There’s a strong focus on becoming a better developer but also on understanding the business and how technology can help support our fast growth.
- Blogging and reading will be required.
- It’s not going to be easy but extremely rewarding :)

Things are off to a great start: my first code contribution went live this week, some haml changes that will help ops and finance skip a step during one of their daily tasks. It forced me to study haml, which I overlooked during CA.

Next week, I’ll learn more about my first long-term project: building data reporting tools for all divisions. We’ll also continue to work on defining the apprenticeship, including listing the technologies that I need to familiarize myself with.

If you have feedback, some advice on structuring an apprenticeship, or just want to wish me good luck, leave a note in the comments below!
