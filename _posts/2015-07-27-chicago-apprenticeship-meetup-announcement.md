It has been a little more than a year since I started as an apprentice. During my time here, I have met a lot of people interested in the apprenticeship program at Trunk Club. Most have very similar questions. What is the apprenticeship like? Did you feel like you could do the work? Did you have support? Did you get to work on anything interesting? These were questions that weren't just asked of me, but of any apprentice at other companies willing to sit down and share their experience. It made me realize that apprenticeships are not all the same and it is still vague what the process is like. I have heard small bits and pieces, but I don’t really know what an apprenticeship is like anywhere else. I’ll write another blog post soon about what it was like here at Trunk Club, but I want to announce the start of a new meet up that will hopefully bring apprentices, and those interested in apprenticeships, together to learn from each other.

The [Chicago Apprenticeship Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Chicago-Apprenticeship-Meetup/events/224063398/) will give apprentices (current and former) the opportunity to present what they spent their time working on, and allow others to learn what worked and didn’t work for them. We will also have more experienced developers come give talks on various topics that might be useful to apprentices such as continual learning, how the internet works, patterns, and more. The first meeting will be August 19th at Trunk Club where our VP of Engineering, Mike Cruz, will talk about our program, and I will share my experience and present my apprenticeship project. 

I’m really excited to get to know more about other apprenticeship programs throughout Chicago. Hopefully, we will be able to find ways to improve current apprenticeships and maybe even inspire other companies to start one! If you, or anyone you know, would like to give a talk, please feel free to reach out to me through the meet up site or on twitter (@aapwild). Or feel free to reach out with any other questions or suggestions. This is brand new so I’m open to any ideas to make this a fun and useful meet up. 

Can’t wait to see you all soon!
