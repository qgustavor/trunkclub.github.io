This week I completed my first major project, a sales report for management. It will evolve over the next few weeks but it’s nice to get version one working. I spent the whole week on it, banging my head against a wall frequently. And then on Friday at 5:30 pm it finally worked. I think there’s no better time for a project to be completed. It feels like a nice, challenging, full week and it ends right on time to enjoy the weekend.

I also needed less help, as things are getting easier. I still need direction and help, getting started but after that things seem to be less difficult than they used to be. And I’m getting more comfortable leaving something unfinished until the next day. I always worried about that but familiarity with the code and the job is all I really needed.

In other news, I was really impressed by [GoodData's](http://www.gooddata.com/) product presentation. They built a slick and powerful tool. It may be doing much more than we need, but I would love to work with them at some point. Although a product offering that services all the pain points of BI is good and bad: it''s nice to only use only one solution but there''s also much less flexibility. And they''re pretty expensive. But overall, great product, great demo (the guys on the call were very good), solid solution.

We had our first hack day today. Two teams of engineers and product managers, eight hours. We worked with the Twilio API to facilitate communications between our members and our stylists. I helped were I could, mostly working on the front-end of the app. I haven’t done much CSS since I got here so it was nice to get to play with it again (thanks [Shay](https://twitter.com/#!/shayhowe) for your [lessons](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/) during Code Academy!). I think it’s pretty obvious that we won but the other team is still arguing about it. The whole company will get to see the demo next week and vote for the winner. I’m curious to see how what we built is going to be re-integrated into our main applications.

Next week: We’re going to start working on an interesting challenge: discontinuing use of a third-party tool that was great to help us get started but that we have outgrown and is now causing too much pain. The sales report that I built this week is going to help, but there’s still a lot more to do. It’ll be exciting to work on it and help the business move to a tool better suited for our current growth.
