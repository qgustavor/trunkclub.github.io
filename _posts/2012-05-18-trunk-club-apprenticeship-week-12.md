This week I built my first Sinatra app! It was refreshing to work with such a simple and lightweight framework. I also got my own Heroku instance to deploy the app, which will allow me to circumvent our usual weekly release cycle in favor of daily code releases while we build up the application.

The main purpose of the app is to run specific queries on our main database to extract KPIs and then output the data in json to be displayed in Geckoboards or another application that would call the service.

In retrospect, I kinda regret that Mike set this Sinatra app up to help me get started. It was simple enough that I should have done it myself. But it makes sense that I still need help.

Since I’m going to work with Sinatra for a little while, I picked up Sinatra: Up and Running by Alan Harris and Konstantin Haase. It’s a short book, with a good section on the basics that can serve as reference. It also features an interesting section that digs deeper into middleware and modular applications. I’ll report on it soon.

Next week: replacing GeckoBoards, finishing deadline.
