There was an interesting presentation at [Geekfest](https://twitter.com/#!/geekfest) today about being a better apprentice. Isaac Sanders, a high school senior interning at Groupon shared stories of successes, and lessons learned from his failures. He has spent the last year of his high school on an “Apprenticeship Tour,” working at EdgeCase and 2Checkout.com in Columbus, OH and at LeanDog in Cleveland, OH. He used a lot of chapters from Dave Hoover’s book on [apprenticeships](http://amzn.com/0596518382) as discussion topics, elaborating on them based on his own experience. He is definitely a strong advocate of apprenticeships, with an interesting experience.

I had a bit of a setback with my month-to-date sales report project and spent a lot of time this week dealing with that. We had to re-think how it was going to be generated, which meant changing our database a bit and dealing with time zone inconsistencies. As disappointing as that was, it was very interesting to review my code from just a few weeks ago. I had to do a lot of refactoring and I felt like my code was getting cleaner and leaner. It was a long but meaningful exercise.

Next week: working on a new BI tool that was developed internally, finishing reading Passionate Programmer, launching the new sales reports.
