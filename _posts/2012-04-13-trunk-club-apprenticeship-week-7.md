This week I have been pairing a lot more. I think I paired with almost every back-end developer that we have. Naturally it reminded me of the 12 weeks of Code Academy. Overall it was very good and I certainly learned a lot. It also helped that everyone I paired with took the time to answer any questions that I had, no matter how trivial or complex.

It was also nice to see how each one of them actually worked. Some focus a lot on TDD, while others have a “get things done” approach. It was refreshing to see that no matter what their level was, each one of them made mistakes or sometimes needed help as well.

Overall, it reaffirms the decision I made to become a programmer.

Regarding the apprenticeship itself, the wiki list of topics is finalized and I updated my previous post about it to reflect the few changes that were made.

Finally, this week during our weekly Team Lunch, Corey did a presentation on MongoDB that helped me finally understand what NOSQL databases are about.

Previously, I had only worked with MS SQL, mysql and Postgresql and never really knew how to use Mongodb. Now I found a good way to use it next week on my GeckoBoard project for data snapshots. Excited!
