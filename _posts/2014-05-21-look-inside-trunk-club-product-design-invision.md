Weâ€™re excited to have been interviewed by our favorite rapid prototyping app, [InVision](http://www.invisionapp.com/). Read their article on the InVision Blog here: [A Look Inside Design at Trunk Club](http://blog.invisionapp.com/a-look-inside-design-at-trunk-club/).

At Trunk Club, rapid prototyping plays a crucial role in our design process for both our internal and external apps. Our early iterations on products never start off perfect. InVision is the quickest way we test and learn about whether or not ideas are going down the right path.
